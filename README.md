# Project Overview
- The dataset contains information of clients from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California.
- Given historical data on loans given out with the knowledge of whether or not the borrower paid off the loan or defaulted, a model was built using a feed forward neural network to predict if future clients would default or not.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing involved filling in missing values of relevant features, dropping redundant features, and feature engineering.
- After training our neural network, the model was able to achieve an overall accuracy of 89%.

The dataset is can be found under lending_club_loan_X.csv (4 separate csv files due to size of the dataset) and the library requirements/versions used for this project are located in the requirements.txt file. <br>

<b>Technologies used for this project:</b> python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, tensorflow, keras.

The information of all the features in the dataset can be found in lending_club_info.csv.
